I took a great course for the basics of Python titled "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python."

The link is below, highly recommend taking it if you have the time. Great instructor, great material, and it's free.

I took notes along with most of the lessons to help understand it better, the notes are in the folder named "abswp" (abbreviation of title) and are named based on the dates I wrote them.
