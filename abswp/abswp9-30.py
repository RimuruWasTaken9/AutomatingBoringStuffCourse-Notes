'''this caused so much pain so I'm gonna talk about it. THE ANSWER WAS
PIPELINES. I tried to figure out how to give it multiple options based on
how the text was formatted so I could detect it regardless, but it always
just returned a jumble of spaces probably because of the groups I added.
But by adding pipelines in between each option, it doesn't give me those
jumbles anymore.
However...it turns out that there might be an even simpler solution, in
the form of character classes and
utilizing +,*, and ? without using parathesis.
